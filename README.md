🌍 Environmental Research Tool
A full-stack environmental research application designed to analyze large-scale climate data efficiently using Scaledown compression and scientific models. The system delivers fast, accurate, and interpretable insights through a modern web interface.
📌 Overview
The Environmental Research Tool allows users to query key environmental parameters—such as temperature, rainfall, CO₂ levels, and sea level—for a selected region and time range.
To handle large climate datasets efficiently, the application applies Scaledown compression before analysis. This significantly reduces data size while preserving critical trends, enabling faster query processing and improved performance. Scientific models are then used for trend analysis and short-term predictions.
